# Simple React App using the Spotify API

A Simple React App enabling you to search for songs on Spotify and create a playlist.

## Features

On render of the page you will be prompted to sign in to your Spotify account (if you aren't logged in on your device already).
Use the search bar to look for songs and add them via pressing the "+" button. On the right you can enter a name for your playlist.
If you have second thoughts you can remove a song from the playlist with the "-" button.
Once your playlist of your dreams is complete, press "Save to Spotify" and enjoy the jam!

## How to run locally

Download the repo -> open the cmd line terminal in the root directory -> enter npm i to install the dependencies.
To make use of it you need to sign up at developer.spotify.com and replace the token you will receive there with
the one defined in the "FetchApi.js" file.
When you are ready enter "npm start" in the terminal, have fun!

## There can be done much more
The API enables you to do many things and once the API coms are set up, as it is in FetchApi, you can add many more features:
loading already existing playlists to edit them or even set up your own player with a like functionality and so on!
Have fun coding!
